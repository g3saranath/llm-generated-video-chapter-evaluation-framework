# Manual Review Workflow for Chapter Evaluation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Manual Review Process**

This guide explains how to perform manual reviews of LLM-generated chapters using the evaluation framework.

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Generate Evaluation Data**
```bash
# Run evaluation and save data for manual review
python evaluate_chapters.py P127jhj-8-Y --manual-review --queries "machine learning,tutorial"
```

This creates a file `manual_review_P127jhj-8-Y.json` with:
- **Chapter information**: Title, summary, timestamps
- **Automated evaluation**: All metrics and scores
- **Detected issues**: Automated issue identification
- **LLM error analysis**: Hallucination, bias, coherence scores
- **Transcript segments**: Source material for comparison
- **Manual review template**: Empty fields for your annotations

### **Step 2: Perform Manual Review**

Open `manual_review_P127jhj-8-Y.json` and fill in the `manual_review_template` section for each chapter:

```json
{
  "manual_review_template": {
    "reviewer_id": "your_reviewer_id",           // Your ID
    "chapter_index": 0,                          // Chapter number
    "overall_quality_score": 4,                  // 1-5 scale
    "content_accuracy_score": 4,                 // 1-5 scale
    "title_appropriateness_score": 5,            // 1-5 scale
    "summary_quality_score": 3,                  // 1-5 scale
    "search_relevance_score": 4,                 // 1-5 scale
    "navigation_utility_score": 4,               // 1-5 scale
    "issues_identified": [                       // List of issues you found
      "Summary could be more comprehensive",
      "Missing some technical details"
    ],
    "recommendations": [                         // Your improvement suggestions
      "Expand summary to include more technical context",
      "Add specific examples from the content"
    ],
    "confidence_level": 0.8                      // 0-1 scale (your confidence)
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Scoring Guidelines**

#### **Overall Quality Score (1-5)**
- **5**: Excellent - No significant issues, high quality
- **4**: Good - Minor issues, generally high quality
- **3**: Fair - Some issues, acceptable quality
- **2**: Poor - Significant issues, needs improvement
- **1**: Very Poor - Major issues, unacceptable quality

#### **Content Accuracy (1-5)**
- **5**: Perfect alignment with transcript, no factual errors
- **4**: High alignment with minor inaccuracies

#### **Title Appropriateness (1-5)**
- **5**: Perfectly captures content and is engaging
- **4**: Accurate description with minor clarity issues
- **3**: Generally appropriate with some ambiguity
- **2**: Partially accurate but misleading
- **1**: Inaccurate or completely misleading

#### **Summary Quality (1-5)**
- **5**: Comprehensive, coherent, covers all key points
- **4**: Good summary with minor gaps
- **3**: Adequate summary missing important details
- **2**: Incomplete summary with significant gaps

- **4**: Good navigation with minor issues
- **3**: Adequate navigation, improvements needed
- **2**: Limited utility, usability concerns
- **1**: Poor navigation, confusing or unhelpful

### **Step 4: Process Your Reviews**

After completing your manual reviews, process them:

```bash
# Process your completed manual reviews
python evaluate_chapters.py P127jhj-8-Y --review-file manual_review_P127jhj-8-Y.json
```

### **Step 5: Review Results**

The system will generate:
- **Automated vs Manual Comparison**: How your scores compare to automated metrics
- **Inter-reviewer Agreement**: If you review chapters multiple times
- **Quality Insights**: Common issues and improvement opportunities
- **System Calibration**: Recommendations for improving automated evaluation
