    "transcript_segment": "connections between different encoder blocks the decoder is very similar to the encoder but there's one difference which is that it has this extra layer because the decoder doesn't just do multi-head attention on the output of the previous layers so so for context the encoder does multi-head attention so each self-retention layer in the encoder block in each of the encoder blocks does multi-head attention looking at the previous layers of the encoder blocks the decoder however does that in the sense that it also looks at the previous layers of the decoder but it also looks at the output of the encoder and so it needs us a multi-head attention layer over the encoder blocks and lastly there's masking as well um so if you are because every token can look at every other token um you want to sort of make sure in the decoder that you're not looking into the future so if you're in position three for instance you shouldn't be able to look at position four and position five so those are sort of all the components that led to the creation of the model in um the vasani idol paper and um let's talk a little bit about the advantages and drawbacks of this model um so the two main advantages which are huge advantages and which are why transformers have done such a good job of revolutionizing many many fields within deep learning um are as follows so so the first is there is this constant path length between any two positions in a sequence because every token in the sequence is looking at every other token and this basically solves the problem that they've talked about earlier with long sequences you don't have this problem with long sequences where if you're trying to predict a token that depends on a word that was far far behind in a sentence you don't have the problem of losing that context now the distance between them is only one in terms of the path length also because the nature of the computation that's happening transformer models lend themselves really well to parallelization and because of the advances that we've had with gpus basically if you take a transfer model with n parameters and you take a model that isn't a transformer say like i can have stm with also with n parameters training the transformer model is going to be much faster because of the parallelization that it leverages so those are the advantages the disadvantages are basically self-attention takes quadratic time because every token looks at every other token order n square as you might know does not scale and there's actually been a lot of work in trying to tackle this so we've linked to some here big bird lin former and reformer are all approaches to try and make this linear or quasi-linear essentially and yeah we highly recommend to recommend going through jay alamer's blog the illustrated transformer which provides great visualizations and explains everything that we just talked about in great detail yeah and i'd like to pass it on to chaitanya for applications of transformers yeah so now moving on to like some of the recent work uh some of the work that uh very shortly followed the",

    "transcript_segment": "the recent work uh some of the work that uh very shortly followed the transformers paper so one of the models that came out uh was gpt the gbt architecture which was released by open eyes so uh so open ei had the latest model that opened here has in the gpt series is the gpd3 so it consists of only the decoder blocks from transformers and is trained on our traditional language modeling task which is uh predicting the current token which is separating the next token given the last uh t tokens that that the model has seen and for any downstream tasks now the model can just you can just train a classification layer on the last hidden state which can be which can have any number of labels and since the model is generative in nature you can also use the pre-trained network as uh for generative kind of tasks such as summarization and natural language and natural language generation for things for that instance another important aspect that gpt 3 gained popularity was its ability to to be able to perform in context learning what the authors called into context learning so this is the ability wherein the model can perform can learn under few short settings uh what what the task is to complete the task without performing any gradient updates for example let's say the model is shown a bunch of addition examples and then if you pass in a new uh input and leave the uh and just leave it at uh at equal to sign the model tries to predict the act next token uh which very well comes out to be the sum of the uh the sum of the numbers that's that is shown another example can be also the spell correction task or the translation task so this is this was the ability that uh made gpt 3 so much uh uh talked about in the nlp world and uh right now also like many applications have been made using gp3 which includes uh the one of them being the vs code co-pilot which uh tries to which tries to generate a piece of code given our doctrine kind of natural language text another major uh model that came out that was based on the transformers architecture was bird so but uh lends its name from it's an acronym for bi-directional encoding encoder representations of transformers it consists of uh only the encoder blocks of the transformers which is unlike gpd3 which had only the decoder blocks now this prop because of this change there there comes a problem because uh because bert has only the encoder block so it sees the entire piece of text it cannot be pre-trained on a live language modeling task because of the problem of data leakage from the future so what the authors came up with was a clever idea and they uh and they came up with a novel task called mass language modeling which was uh which included to replace certain birds with a placeholder and then the model tries to predict those words given the entire context now apart from this token level task there was the authors also added a second objective called the next sentence prediction which was a sentence level task wherein given two chunks of text the model tried to predict whether the second sentence followed the other sentence or not follow the first sentence or not and now for after pre-training this model for any downstream task the model can be further fine-tuned with an additional classification layer just like it was in chip e3 so ah these are the two models that were that have been like very popular and have made a lot of applications made their way in lot of applications but the landscape has changed quite a lot since we have taken this class there are models with different pre-training techniques like elektra d berta and there are also models that do well in like other modalities and which we're going to be talking about in other lecture series as well so yeah that's all from this lecture and thank you for tuning in yeah um just want to just want to end by saying thank you all for watching this and we have a really exciting set of videos with truly amazing speakers and we hope you are able to derive value from that thanks a lot thank you thank you everyone you",
