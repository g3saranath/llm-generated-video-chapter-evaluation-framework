    "transcript_segment": "to do that because we're going to train that Transformer on Shakespeare and it's just going to try to produce uh character sequences that look like this and in that process is going to model all the patterns inside this data so once we've trained the system i' just like to give you a preview we can generate infinite Shakespeare and of course it's a fake thing that looks kind of like Shakespeare um apologies for there's some Jank that I'm not able to resolve in in here but um you can see how this is going character by character and it's kind of like predicting Shakespeare like language so verily my Lord the sites have left the again the king coming with my curses with precious pale and then tranos say something else Etc and this is just coming out of the Transformer in a very similar manner as it would come out in chat GPT in our case character by character in chat GPT uh it's coming out on the token by token level and tokens are these sort of like little subword pieces so they're not Word level they're kind of like word chunk level um and now I've already written this entire code uh to train these Transformers um and it is in a GitHub repository that you can find and it's called nanog GPT so nanog GPT is a repository that you can find in my GitHub and it's a repository for training Transformers um on any given text and what I think is interesting about it because there's many ways to train Transformers but this is a very simple implementation so it's just two files of 300 lines of code each one file defines the GPT model the Transformer and one file trains it on some given Text data set and here I'm showing that if you train it on a open web Text data set which is a fairly large data set of web pages then I reproduce the the performance of gpt2 so gpt2 is an early version of open AI GPT uh from 2017 if I recall correctly and I've only so far reproduced the the smallest 124 million parameter model uh but basically this is just proving that the codebase is correctly arranged and I'm able to load the uh neural network weights that openi has released later so you can take a look at the finished code here in N GPT but what I would like to do in this lecture is I would like to basically uh write this repository from scratch so we're going to begin with an empty file and we're we're going to define a Transformer piece by piece we're going to train it on the tiny Shakespeare data set and we'll see how we can then uh generate infinite Shakespeare and of course this can copy paste to any arbitrary Text data set uh that you like uh but my goal really here is to just make you understand and appreciate uh how under the hood chat GPT works and um really all that's required is a Proficiency in Python and uh some basic understanding of um calculus and statistics and it would help if you also see my previous videos on the same YouTube channel in particular my make more series where I um Define smaller and simpler neural network language models uh so multi perceptrons and so on it really introduces the language modeling framework and then uh here in this video we're going to focus on the Transformer neural network itself okay so I created a new Google collab uh jup notebook here and this will allow me to later easily share this code that we're going to develop together uh with you so you can follow along so this will be in a video description uh later now here I've just done some preliminaries I downloaded the data set the tiny Shakespeare data set at this URL and you can see that it's about a 1 Megabyte file then here I open the input.txt file and just read in all the text of the string and we see that we are working with 1 million characters roughly and the first 1,000 characters if we just print them out are basically what you would expect this is the first 1,000 characters of the tiny Shakespeare data set roughly up to here so so far so good next we're going to take this text and the text is a sequence of characters in Python so when I call the set Constructor on it I'm just going to get the set of all the characters that occur in this text and then I call list on that to create a list of those characters instead of just a set so that I have an ordering an arbitrary ordering and then I sort that so basically we get just all the characters that occur in the entire data set and they're sorted now the number of them is going to be our vocabulary size these are the possible elements of our sequences and we see that when I print here the characters there's 65 of them in total there's a space character and then all kinds of special characters and then U capitals and lowercase letters so that's our vocabulary and that's the sort of like possible uh characters that the model can see or emit okay so next we will would like to develop some strategy to tokenize the input text now when people say tokenize they mean convert the raw text as a string to some sequence of integers According to some uh notebook According to some vocabulary of possible elements so as an example here we are going to be building a character level language model so we're simply going to be translating individual characters into integers so let me show you uh a chunk of code that sort of does that for us so we're building both the encoder and the decoder and let me just talk through what's happening here when we encode an arbitrary text like hi there we're going to receive a list of integers that represents that string so for example 46 47 Etc and then we also have the reverse mapping so we can take this list and decode it to get back the exact same string so it's really just like a translation to integers and back for arbitrary string and for us it is done on a character level now the way this was achieved is we just iterate over all the characters here and create a lookup table from the character to the integer and vice versa and then to encode some string we simply translate all the characters individually and to decode it back we use the reverse mapping and concatenate all of it now this is only one of many possible encodings or many possible sort of tokenizers and it's a very simple one but there's many other schemas that people have come up with in practice so for example Google uses a sentence piece uh so sentence piece will also encode text into um integers but in a different schema and using a different vocabulary and sentence piece is a subword uh sort of tokenizer and what that means is that um you're not encoding entire words but you're not also encoding individual characters it's it's a subword unit level and that's usually what's adopted in practice for example also openai has this Library called tick token that uses a bite pair encode tokenizer um and that's what GPT uses and you can also just encode words into like hell world into a list of integers so as an example I'm using the Tik token Library here I'm getting the encoding for gpt2 or that was used for gpt2 instead of just having 65 possible characters or tokens they have 50,000 tokens and so when they encode the exact same string High there we only get a list of three integers but those integers are not between 0 and 64 they are between Z and 5, 5,256 so basically you can trade off the code book size and the sequence lengths so you can have very long sequences of integers with very small vocabularies or we can have short um sequences of integers with very large vocabularies and so typically people use in practice these subword encodings but I'd like to keep our token ier very simple so we're using character level tokenizer and that means that we have very small code books we have very simple encode and decode functions uh but we do get very long sequences as a result but that's the level at which we're going to stick with this lecture because it's the simplest thing okay so now that we have an encoder and a decoder effectively a tokenizer we can tokenize the entire training set of Shakespeare so here's a chunk of code that does that and I'm going to start to use the pytorch library and specifically the torch. tensor from the pytorch library so we're going to take all of the text in tiny Shakespeare encode it and then wrap it into a torch. tensor to get the data tensor so here's what the data tensor looks like when I look at just the first 1,000 characters or the 1,000 elements of it so we see that we have a massive sequence of integers and this sequence of integers here is basically an identical translation of the first 10,000 characters here so I believe for example that zero is a new line character and maybe one one is a space not 100% sure but from now on the entire data set of text is re-represented as just it's just stretched out as a single very large uh sequence of integers let me do one more thing before we move on here I'd like to separate out our data set into a train and a validation split so in particular we're going to take the first 90% of the data set and consider that to be the training data for the Transformer and we're going to withhold the last 10% at the end of it to be the validation data and this will help us understand to what extent our model is overfitting so we're going to basically hide and keep the validation data on the side because we don't want just a perfect memorization of this exact Shakespeare we want a neural network that sort of creates Shakespeare like uh text and so it should be fairly likely for it to produce the actual like stowed away uh true Shakespeare text um and so we're going to use this to uh get a sense of the overfitting okay so now we would like to start plugging these text sequences or integer sequences into the",

    "transcript_segment": "sequences or integer sequences into the Transformer so that it can train and learn those patterns now the important thing to realize is we're never going to actually feed entire text into a Transformer all at once that would be computationally very expensive and prohibitive so when we actually train a Transformer on a lot of these data sets we only work with chunks of the data set and when we train the Transformer we basically sample random little chunks out of the training set and train on just chunks at a time and these chunks have basically some kind of a length and some maximum length now the maximum length typically at least in the code I usually write is called block size you can you can uh find it under different names like context length or something like that let's start with the block size of just eight and let me look at the first train data characters the first block size plus one characters I'll explain why plus one in a second so this is the first nine characters in the sequence in the training set now what I'd like to point out is that when you sample a chunk of data like this so say the these nine characters out of the training set this actually has multiple examples packed into it and uh that's because all of these characters follow each other and so what this thing is going to say when we plug it into a Transformer is we're going to actually simultaneously train it to make prediction at every one of these positions now in the in a chunk of nine characters there's actually eight indiv ual examples packed in there so there's the example that when 18 when in the context of 18 47 likely comes next in a context of 18 and 47 56 comes next in a context of 18 47 56 57 can come next and so on so that's the eight individual examples let me actually spell it out with code so here's a chunk of code to illustrate X are the inputs to the Transformer it will just be the first block size characters y will be the uh next block size characters so it's offset by one and that's because y are the targets for each position in the input and then here I'm iterating over all the block size of eight and the context is always all the characters in x uh up to T and including T and the target is always the teth character but in the targets array y so let me just run this and basically it spells out what I said in words uh these are the eight examples hidden in a chunk of nine characters that we uh sampled from the training set I want to mention one more thing we train on all the eight examples here with context between one all the way up to context of block size and we train on that not just for computational reasons because we happen to have the sequence already or something like that it's not just done for efficiency it's also done um to make the Transformer Network be used to seeing contexts all the way from as little as one all the way to block size and we'd like the transform to be used to seeing everything in between and that's going to be useful later during inference because while we're sampling we can start the sampling generation with as little as one character of context and the Transformer knows how to predict the next character with all the way up to just context of one and so then it can predict everything up to block size and after block size we have to start truncating because the Transformer will will never um receive more than block size inputs when it's predicting the next character Okay so we've looked at the time dimension of the tensors that are going to be feeding into the Transformer there's one more Dimension to care about and that is the batch Dimension and so as we're sampling these chunks of text we're going to be actually every time we're going to feed them into a Transformer we're going to have many batches of multiple chunks of text that are all like stacked up in a single tensor and that's just done for efficiency just so that we can keep the gpus busy uh because they are very good at parallel processing of um of data and so we just want to process multiple chunks all at the same time but those chunks are processed completely independently they don't talk to each other and so on so let me basically just generalize this and introduce a batch Dimension here's a chunk of code let me just run it and then I'm going to explain what it does so here because we're going to start sampling random locations in the data set to pull chunks from I am setting the seed so that um in the random number generator so that the numbers I see here are going to be the same numbers you see later if you try to reproduce this now the batch size here is how many independent sequences we are processing every forward backward pass of the Transformer the block size as I explained is the maximum context length to make those predictions so let's say B size four block size eight and then here's how we get batch for any arbitrary split if the split is a training split then we're going to look at train data otherwise at valid data that gives us the data array and then when I Generate random positions to grab a chunk out of I actually grab I actually generate batch size number of Random offsets so because this is four we are ex is going to be a uh four numbers that are randomly generated between zero and Len of data minus block size so it's just random offsets into the training set and then X's as I explained are the first first block size characters starting at I the Y's are the offset by one of that so just add plus one and then we're going to get those chunks for every one of integers I INX and use a torch. stack to take all those uh uh one-dimensional tensors as we saw here and we're going to um stack them up at rows and so they all become a row in a 4x8 tensor so here's where I'm printing then when I sample a batch XB and YB the inputs to the Transformer now are the input X is the 4x8 tensor four uh rows of eight columns and each one of these is a chunk of the training set and then the targets here are in the associated array Y and they will come in to the Transformer all the way at the end uh to um create the loss function uh so they will give us the correct answer for every single position inside X and then these are the four independent rows so spelled out as we did before uh this 4x8 array contains a total of 32 examples and they're",

    "transcript_segment": "that we developed in this juper notebook and I converted it to be a script and I'm doing this because I just want to simplify our intermediate work into just the final product that we have at this point so in the top here I put all the hyp parameters that we to find I introduced a few and I'm going to speak to that in a little bit otherwise a lot of this should be recognizable uh reproducibility read data get the encoder and the decoder create the train into splits uh use the uh kind of like data loader um that gets a batch of the inputs and Targets this is new and I'll talk about it in a second now this is the Byram language model that we developed and it can forward and give us a logits and loss and it can generate and then here we are creating the optimizer and this is the training Loop so everything here should look pretty familiar now some of the small things that I added number one I added the ability to run on a GPU if you have it so if you have a GPU then you can this will use Cuda instead of just CPU and everything will be a lot more faster now when device becomes Cuda then we need to make sure that when we load the data we move it to device when we create the model we want to move uh the model parameters to device so as an example here we have the N an embedding table and it's got a weight inside it which stores the uh sort of lookup table so so that would be moved to the GPU so that all the calculations here happen on the GPU and they can be a lot faster and then finally here when I'm creating the context that feeds in to generate I have to make sure that I create it on the device number two what I introduced is uh the fact that here in the training Loop here I was just printing the um l. item inside the training Loop but this is a very noisy measurement of the current loss because every batch will be more or less lucky and so what I want to do usually um is uh I have an estimate loss function and the estimate loss basically then um goes up here and it averages up the loss over multiple batches so in particular we're going to iterate eval iter times and we're going to basically get our loss and then we're going to get the average loss for both splits and so this will be a lot less noisy so here when we call the estimate loss we're we're going to report the uh pretty accurate train and validation loss now when we come back up you'll notice a few things here I'm setting the model to evaluation phase and down here I'm resetting it back to training phase now right now for our model as is this doesn't actually do anything because the only thing inside this model is this uh nn. embedding and um this this um Network would behave both would behave the same in both evaluation mode and training mode we have no drop off layers we have no batm layers Etc but it is a good practice to Think Through what mode your neural network is in because some layers will have different Behavior Uh at inference time or training time and there's also this context manager torch up nograd and this is just telling pytorch that everything that happens inside this function we will not call do backward on and so pytorch can be a lot more efficient with its memory use because it doesn't have to store all the intermediate variables uh because we're never going to call backward and so it can it can be a lot more memory efficient in that way so also a good practice to tpy torch when we don't intend to do back propagation so right now this script is about 120 lines of code of and that's kind of our starter code I'm calling it b.p and I'm going to release it later now running this script gives us output in the terminal and it looks something like this it basically as I ran this code uh it was giving me the train loss and Val loss and we see that we convert to somewhere around 2.5 with the pyr model and then here's the sample that we produced at the end and so we have everything packaged up in the script and we're in a good position now to iterate on this okay so we are almost ready to start writing our very first self attention block for processing these uh tokens now before we actually get there I want to get you used to a mathematical trick that is",

    "transcript_segment": "about doing this using matrix multiplication so that's the mathematical trick and let me show you what I mean let's work with the toy example here let me run it and I'll explain I have a simple Matrix here that is a 3X3 of all ones a matrix B of just random numbers and it's a 3x2 and a matrix C which will be 3x3 multip 3x2 which will give out a 3x2 so here we're just using um matrix multiplication so a multiply B gives us C okay so how are these numbers in C um achieved right so this number in the top left is the first row of a dot product with the First Column of B and since all the the row of a right now is all just ones then the do product here with with this column of B is just going to do a sum of these of this column so 2 + 6 + 6 is 14 the element here in the output of C is also the first column here the first row of a multiplied now with the second column of B so 7 + 4 + 5 is 16 now you see that there's repeating elements here so this 14 again is because this row is again all ones and it's multiplying the First Column of B so we get 14 and this one is and so on so this last number here is the last row do product last column now the trick here is uh the following this is just a boring number of um it's just a boring array of all ones but torch has this function called Trail which is short for a triangular uh something like that and you can wrap it in torch up once and it will just return the lower triangular portion of this okay so now it will basically zero out uh these guys here so we just get the lower triangular part well what happens if we do that so now we'll have a like this and B like this and now what are we getting here in C well what is this number well this is the first row times the First Column and because this is zeros uh these elements here are now ignored so we just get a two and then this number here is the first row times the second column and because these are zeros they get ignored and it's just seven this seven multiplies this one but look what happened here because this is one and then zeros we what ended up happening is we're just plucking out the row of this row of B and that's what we got now here we have one 1 Z so here 110 do product with these two columns will now give us 2 + 6 which is 8 and 7 + 4 which is 11 and because this is 111 we ended up with the addition of all of them and so basically depending on how many ones and zeros we have here we are basically doing a sum currently of a variable number of these rows and that gets deposited into C So currently we're doing sums because these are ones but we can also do average right and you can start to see how we could do average uh of the rows of B uh sort of in an incremental fashion because we don't have to we can basically normalize these rows so that they sum to one and then we're going to get an average so if we took a and then we did aals aide torch. sum in the um of a in the um oneth Dimension and then let's keep them as true so so therefore the broadcasting will work out so if I rerun this you see now that these rows now sum to one so this row is one this row is 0. 5.5 Z and here we get 1/3 and now when we do a multiply B what are we getting here we are just getting the first row first row here now we are getting the average of the first two rows okay so 2 and six average is four and four and seven average is 5.5 and on the bottom here we are now getting the average of these three rows so the average of all of elements of B are now deposited here and so you can see that by manipulating these uh elements of this multiplying Matrix and then multiplying it with any given Matrix we can do these averages in this incremental fashion because we just get um and we can manipulate that based on the elements of a okay so that's very convenient so let's let's swing back up here and see how we can vectorize this and make it much more efficient using what we've learned so in particular we are going to produce an array a but here I'm going to call it we short for weights but this is our a and this is how much of every row we want to average up and it's going to be an average because you can see that these rows sum to one so this is our a and then our B in this example of course is X so what's going to happen here now is that we are going to have an expo 2 and this Expo 2 is going to be way multiplying RX so let's think this true way is T BYT and this is Matrix multiplying in pytorch a b by T by C and it's giving us uh different what shape so pytorch will come here and it will see that these shapes are not the same so it will create a batch Dimension here and this is a batched matrix multiply and so it will apply this matrix multiplication in all the batch elements um in parallel and individually and then for each batch element there will be a t BYT multiplying T by C exactly as we had below so this will now create B by T by C and Expo 2 will now become identical to Expo so we can see that torch. all close of xbo and xbo 2 should be true now so this kind of like convinces us that uh these are in fact um the same so xbo and xbo 2 if I just print them uh okay we're not going to be able to okay we're not going to be able to just stare it down but um well let me try Expo basically just at the zeroth element and Expo two at the zeroth element so just the first batch and we should see that this and that should be identical which they are right so what happened here the trick is we were able to use batched Matrix multiply to do this uh aggregation really and it's a weighted aggregation and the weights are specified in this um T BYT array and we're basically doing weighted sums and uh these weighted sums are are U according to uh the weights inside here they take on sort of this triangular form and so that means that a token at the teth dimension will only get uh sort of um information from the um tokens perceiving it so that's exactly what we want and finally I would like to rewrite it in one more way and we're going to see why that's useful so this is the third version and it's also identical to the first and second but let me talk through it it uses softmax so Trill here is this Matrix lower triangular ones way begins as all zero okay so if I just print way in the beginning it's all zero then I used masked fill so what this is doing is we. masked fill it's all zeros and I'm saying for all the elements where Trill is equal equal Z make them be negative Infinity so all the elements where Trill is zero will become negative Infinity now so this is what we get and then the final line here is softmax so if I take a softmax along every single so dim is negative one so along every single row if I do softmax what is that going to do well softmax is um is also like a normalization operation right and so spoiler alert you get the exact same Matrix let me bring back to softmax and recall that in softmax we're going to exponentiate every single one of these and then we're going to divide by the sum and so if we exponentiate every single element here we're going to get a one and here we're going to get uh basically zero 0 z0 Z everywhere else and then when we normalize we just get one here we're going to get one one and then zeros and then softmax will again divide and this will give us 5.5 and so on and so this is also the uh the same way to produce uh this mask now the reason that this is a bit more interesting and the reason we're going to end up using it in self attention is that these weights here begin uh with zero and you can think of this as like an interaction strength or like an affinity so basically it's telling us how much of each uh token from the past do we want to Aggregate and average up and then this line is saying tokens from the past cannot communicate by setting them to negative Infinity we're saying that we will not aggregate anything from those tokens and so basically this then goes through softmax and through the weighted and this is the aggregation through matrix multiplication and so what this is now is you can think of these as um these zeros are currently just set by us to be zero but a quick preview is that these affinities between the tokens are not going to be just constant at zero they're going to be data dependent these tokens are going to start looking at each other and some tokens will find other tokens more or less interesting and depending on what their values are they're going to find each other interesting to different amounts and I'm going to call those affinities I think and then here we are saying the future cannot communicate with the past we're we're going to clamp them and then when we normalize and sum we're going to aggregate uh sort of their values depending on how interesting they find each other and so that's the preview for self attention and basically long story short from this entire section is that you can do weighted aggregations of your past Elements by having by using matrix multiplication of a lower triangular fashion and then the elements here in the lower triangular part are telling you how much of each element uh fuses into this position so we're going to use this trick now to develop the self attention block block so first let's get some quick preliminaries out of the way",

    "transcript_segment": "me you keep hearing me say attention self attention Etc there's actually also something called cross attention what is the difference so basically the reason this attention is self attention is because because the keys queries and the values are all coming from the same Source from X so the same Source X produces Keys queries and values so these nodes are self attending but in principle attention is much more General than that so for example an encoder decoder Transformers uh you can have a case where the queries are produced from X but the keys and the values come from a whole separate external source and sometimes from uh encoder blocks that encode some context that we'd like to condition on and so the keys and the values will actually come from a whole separate Source those are nodes on the side and here we're just producing queries and we're reading off information from the side so cross attention is used when there's a separate source of nodes we'd like to pull information from into our nodes and it's self attention if we just have nodes that would like to look at each other and talk to each other so this attention here happens to be self attention but in principle um attention is a lot more General okay and the last note at this stage is if we come to the attention is all need paper here we've already implemented attention so given query key and value we've U multiplied the query and a key we've soft maxed it and then we are aggregating the values there's one more thing that we're missing here which is the dividing by one / square root of the head size the DK here is the head size why are they doing this finds this important so they call it the scaled attention and it's kind of like an important normalization to basically have the problem is if you have unit gsh and inputs so zero mean unit variance K and Q are unit gashin then if you just do we naively then you see that your we actually will be uh the variance will be on the order of head size which in our case is 16 but if you multiply by one over head size square root so this is square root and this is one over then the variance of we will be one so it will be preserved now why is this important you'll not notice that way here will feed into softmax and so it's really important especially at initialization that we be fairly diffuse so in our case here we sort of locked out here and we had a fairly diffuse numbers here so um like this now the problem is that because of softmax if weight takes on very positive and very negative numbers inside it softmax will actually converge towards one hot vectors and so I can illustrate that here um say we are applying softmax to a tensor of values that are very close to zero then we're going to get a diffuse thing out of softmax but the moment I take the exact same thing and I start sharpening it making it bigger by multiplying these numbers by eight for example you'll see that the softmax will start to sharpen and in fact it will sharpen towards the max so it will sharpen towards whatever number here is the highest and so um basically we don't want these values to be too extreme especially at initialization otherwise softmax will be way too peaky and um you're basically aggregating um information from like a single node every node just agregates information from a single other node that's not what we want especially at initialization and so the scaling is used just to control the variance at initialization okay so having said all that let's now take our self attention knowledge and let's uh take it for a spin so here in the code I created this head module and it implements a single head of self attention so you give it a head size and then here it creates the key query and the value linear layers typically people don't use biases in",

    "transcript_segment": "and we don't have the encoder we just have the decoder and the reason we have a decoder only uh is because we are just uh generating text and it's unconditioned on anything we're just we're just blabbering on according to a given data set what makes it a decoder is that we are using the Triangular mask in our uh trans former so it has this Auto regressive property where we can just uh go and sample from it so the fact that it's using the Triangular triangular mask to mask out the attention makes it a decoder and it can be used for language modeling now the reason that the original paper had an incoder decoder architecture is because it is a machine translation paper so it is concerned with a different setting in particular it expects some uh tokens that encode say for example French and then it is expecting to decode the translation in English so so you typically these here are special tokens so you are expected to read in this and condition on it and then you start off the generation with a special token called start so this is a special new token um that you introduce and always place in the beginning and then the network is expected to Output neural networks are awesome and then a special end token to finish the generation so this part here will be decoded exactly as we we've done it neural networks are awesome will be identical to what we did but unlike what we did they wanton to condition the generation on some additional information and in that case this additional information is the French sentence that they should be translating so what they do now is they bring in the encoder now the encoder reads this part here so we're only going to take the part of French and we're going to uh create tokens from it exactly as we've seen in our video and we're going to put a Transformer on it but there's going to be no triangular mask and so all the tokens are allowed to talk to each other as much as they want and they're just encoding whatever's the content of this French uh sentence once they've encoded it they they basically come out in the top here and then what happens here is in our decoder which does the uh language modeling there's an additional connection here to the outputs of the encoder and that is brought in through a cross attention so the queries are still generated from X but now the keys and the values are coming from the side the keys and the values are coming from the top generated by the nodes that came outside of the de the encoder and those tops the keys and the values there the top of it feed in on a side into every single block of the decoder and so that's why there's an additional cross attention and really what it's doing is it's conditioning the decoding not just on the past of this current decoding but also on having seen the full fully encoded French um prompt sort of and so it's an encoder decoder model which is why we have those two Transformers an additional block and so on so we did not do this because we have no we have nothing to encode there's no conditioning we just have a text file and we just want to imitate it and that's why we are using a decoder only Transformer exactly as done in GPT okay okay so now I wanted to do a very brief walkthrough of nanog GPT",

    "transcript_segment": "the pre-training stage and then the fine-tuning stage in the pre-training stage uh we are training on a large chunk of internet and just trying to get a first decoder only Transformer to babble text so it's very very similar to what we've done ourselves except we've done like a tiny little baby pre-training step um and so in our case uh this is how you print a number of parameters I printed it and it's about 10 million so this Transformer that I created here to create little Shakespeare um Transformer was about 10 million parameters our data set is roughly 1 million uh characters so roughly 1 million tokens but you have to remember that opening I is different vocabulary they're not on the Character level they use these um subword chunks of words and so they have a vocabulary of 50,000 roughly elements and so their sequences are a bit more condensed so our data set the Shakespeare data set would be probably around 300,000 uh tokens in the open AI vocabulary roughly so we trained about 10 million parameter model on roughly 300,000 tokens now when you go to the gpt3 paper and you look at the Transformers that they trained they trained a number of trans Transformers of different sizes but the biggest Transformer here has 175 billion parameters uh so ours is again 10 million they used this number of layers in the Transformer this is the nmed this is the number of heads and this is the head size and then this is the batch size uh so ours was 65 and the learning rate is similar now when they train this Transformer they trained on 300 billion tokens so again remember ours is about 300,000 so this is uh about a millionfold increase and this number would not be even that large by today's standards you'd be going up uh 1 trillion and above so they are training a significantly larger model on uh a good chunk of the internet and that is the pre-training stage but otherwise these hyper parameters should be fairly recognizable to you and the architecture is actually like nearly identical to what we implemented ourselves but of course it's a massive infrastructure challenge to train this you're talking about typically thousands of gpus having to you know talk to each other to train models of this size so that's just a pre-training stage now after you complete the pre-training stage uh you don't get something that responds to your questions with answers and is not helpful and Etc you get a document completer right so it babbles but it doesn't Babble Shakespeare it babbles internet it will create arbitrary news articles and documents and it will try to complete documents because that's what it's trained for it's trying to complete the sequence so when you give it a question it would just uh potentially just give you more questions it would follow with more questions it will do whatever it looks like the some close document would do in the training data on the internet and so who knows you're getting kind of like undefined Behavior it might basically answer with to questions with other questions it might ignore your question it might just try to complete some news article it's totally unineed as we say so the second fine-tuning stage is to actually align it to be an assistant and uh this is the second stage and so this chat GPT block post from openi talks a little bit about how the stage is achieved we basically um there's roughly three steps to to this stage uh so what they do here is they start to collect training data that looks specifically like what an assistant would do so these are documents that have to format where the question is on top and then an answer is below and they have a large number of these but probably not on the order of the internet uh this is probably on the of maybe thousands of examples and so they they then fine-tune the model to basically only focus on documents that look like that and so you're starting to slowly align it so it's going to expect a question at the top and it's going to expect to complete the answer and uh these very very large models are very sample efficient during their fine-tuning so this actually somehow works but that's just step one that's just fine tuning so then they actually have more steps where okay the second step is you let the model respond and then different Raiders look at the different responses and rank them for their preference as to which one is better than the other they use that to train a reward model so they can predict uh basically using a different network how much of any candidate response would be desirable and then once they have a reward model they run po which is a form of polic policy gradient um reinforcement learning Optimizer to uh fine-tune this sampling policy uh so that the answers that the GP chat GPT now generates are expected to score a high reward according to the reward model and so basically there's a whole aligning stage here or fine-tuning stage it's got multiple steps in between there as well and it takes the model from being a document completer to a question answerer and that's like a whole separate stage a lot of this data is not available publicly it is internal to open AI and uh it's much harder to replicate this stage um and so that's roughly what would give you a chat GPT and nanog GPT focuses on the pre-training stage okay and that's everything that I wanted to cover today so we trained to summarize a decoder only Transformer following this famous paper attention is all you need from 2017 and so that's basically a GPT we trained it on Tiny Shakespeare and got sensible results all of the training code is roughly 200 lines of code I will be releasing this um code base so also it comes with all the git log commits along the way as we built it up in addition to this code I'm going to release the um notebook of course the Google collab and I hope that gave you a sense for how you can train um these models like say gpt3 that will be um architecturally basically identical to what we have but they are somewhere between 10,000 and 1 million times bigger depending on how you count and so uh that's all I have for now uh we did not talk about any of the fine-tuning stages that would typically go on top of",
