And today, the\nmind-blowing discovery that's rocking\neveryone's world is a type of neural network\ncalled a transformer. Transformers are models that\ncan translate text, write poems and op-eds, and even\ngenerate computer code. They could be used in biology\nto solve the protein folding problem. Transformers are like\nthis magical machine learning hammer that seems to\nmake every problem into a nail. If you've heard of the\ntrendy new ML models BERT, or GPT-3, or T5,\nall of these models are based on transformers. So if you want to stay\nhip in machine learning and especially in natural\nlanguage processing, you have to know\nabout the transformer. So in this video,\nI'm going to tell you about what transformers\nare, how they work, and why they've\nbeen so impactful."

      "transcript_segment": "Let's get to it. So what is a transformer? It's a type of neural\nnetwork architecture. To recap, neural networks\nare a very effective type of model for analyzing\ncomplicated data types, like images,\nvideos, audio, and text. But there are different types\nof neural networks optimized for different types of data. Like if you're analyzing\nimages, you would typically use a convolutional\nneural network, which is designed\nto vaguely mimic the way that the human\nbrain processes vision. And since around\n2012, neural networks have been really good\nat solving vision tasks, like identifying\nobjects in photos. But for a long time, we didn't\nhave anything comparably good for analyzing language,\nwhether for translation, or text summarization,\nor text generation. And this is a problem, because\nlanguage is the primary way that humans communicate. You see, until transformers\ncame around, the way we used deep learning\nto understand text was with a type of model called\na Recurrent Neural Network, or an RNN, that looked\nsomething like this. Let's say you wanted\nto translate a sentence from English to French. An RNN would take as\ninput an English sentence and process the\nwords one at a time, and then sequentially spit\nout their French counterparts. The keyword here is sequential. In language, the order\nof words matters, and you can't just\nshuffle them around. For example, the sentence\nJane went looking for trouble means something very different\nthan the sentence Trouble went looking for Jane. So any model that's going\nto deal with language has to capture word order,\nand recurrent neural networks do this by looking at one\nword at a time sequentially. But RNNs had a lot of problems. First, they never\nreally did well at handling large sequences\nof text, like long paragraphs or essays. By the time they were analyzing\nthe end of a paragraph, they'd forget what\nhappened in the beginning. And even worse, RNNs were\npretty hard to train. Because they process\nwords sequentially, they couldn't\nparalellize well, which means that you couldn't just\nspeed them up by throwing lots of GPUs at them. And when you have a model\nthat's slow to train, you can't train it on\nall that much data. This is where the transformer\nchanged everything."

Really big. Remember GPT-3, that model\nthat writes poetry and code, and has conversations? That was trained on almost\n45 terabytes of text data, including almost the\nentire public web.

Let's start by talking\nabout the first one, positional encodings. Let's say we're trying\nto translate text from English to French. Positional encodings is\nthe idea that instead of looking at\nwords sequentially, you take each word\nin your sentence, and before you feed it\ninto the neural network, you slap a number on it-- 1, 2, 3, depending\non what number the word is in the sentence. In other words, you\nstore information about word order\nin the data itself, rather than in the\nstructure of the network. Then as you train the\nnetwork on lots of text data, it learns how to interpret\nthose positional encodings. In this way, the neural\nnetwork learns the importance of word order from the data. This is a high level\nway to understand positional encodings,\nbut it's an innovation that really helped make\ntransformers easier to train than RNNs. The next innovation\nin this paper"

In fact, the title of the\noriginal transformer paper is \"Attention Is All You Need.\" So the agreement on the\nEuropean economic area was signed in August 1992. Did you know that? That's the example sentence\ngiven in the original paper. And remember, the\noriginal transformer was designed for translation. Now imagine trying to translate\nthat sentence to French. One bad way to translate text\nis to try to translate each word one for one. But in French, some\nwords are flipped, like in the French translation,\nEuropean comes before economic. Plus, French is a\nlanguage that has gendered agreement between words. So the word [FRENCH] needs\nto be in the feminine form to match with [FRENCH]. The attention mechanism is\na neural network structure that allows a text model to\nlook at every single word in the original\nsentence when making a decision about how to\ntranslate a word in the output sentence. In fact, here's a\nnice visualization from that paper that shows what\nwords in the input sentence the model is\nattending to when it makes predictions about a\nword for the output sentence. So when the model outputs\nthe word [FRENCH],, it's looking at the input\nwords European and economic. You can think of this\ndiagram as a sort of heat map for attention. And how does the\nmodel know which words it should be attending to? It's something that's\nlearned over time from data. By seeing thousands of examples\nof French and English sentence pairs, the model\nlearns about gender, and word order, and\nplurality, and all of that grammatical stuff."

The real innovation in\ntransformers was something called self-attention, a twist\non traditional attention. The type of attention\nwe just talked about had to do with aligning\nwords in English and French, which is really important\nfor translation. But what if you're just\ntrying to understand the underlying meaning\nin language so that you can build a network that can do\nany number of language tasks? What's incredible\nabout neural networks, like transformers, is that as\nthey analyze tons of text data, they begin to build up this\ninternal representation or understanding of\nlanguage automatically. They might learn, for example,\nthat the words programmer, and software engineer,\nand software developer are all synonymous. And they might also naturally\nlearn the rules of grammar, and gender, and\ntense, and so on. The better this internal\nrepresentation of language the neural network\nlearns, the better it will be at any language task. And it turns out that attention\ncan be a very effective way to get a neural network\nto understand language if it's turned on the\ninput text itself. Let me give you an example. Take these two sentences-- Server, can I have the check? Versus, Looks like I\njust crashed the server. The word server here means\ntwo very different things. And I know that,\nbecause I'm looking at the context of the\nsurrounding words. Self-attention allows\na neural network to understand a word in the\ncontext of the words around it. So when a model\nprocesses the word server in the first\nsentence, it might be attending to the\nword check, which helps it disambiguate from a\nhuman server versus a mail one. In the second\nsentence, the model might be attending to the\nword crashed to determine that the server is a machine. Self-attention can also\nhelp neural networks disambiguate words,\nrecognize parts of speech, and even identify word tense. This, in a nutshell, is the\nvalue of self-attention. So to summarize,\ntransformers boil down"

BERT was trained on\na massive text corpus and has become this sort\nof general pocketknife for NLP that can be adapted\nto a bunch of different tasks, like text summarization,\nquestion answering, classification, and\nfinding similar sentences. It's used in Google Search to\nhelp understand search queries, and it powers a lot of\nGoogle Cloud's NLP tools, like Google Cloud\nAutoML Natural Language. BERT also proved that you\ncould build very good models on unlabeled data,\nlike text scraped from Wikipedia or Reddit. This is called\nsemi-supervised learning, and it's a big trend in\nmachine learning right now. So if I've sold you about\nhow cool transformers are, you might want to start\nusing them in your app. No problem."
