      "title": "Attention Mechanism: Enabling Contextual Understanding in Translation",
      "summary": "Details the attention mechanism, which lets the model consider all words in a sentence when translating or processing text, rather than word-by-word translation. Using an example sentence from the original transformer paper, it illustrates how attention helps capture word order, gender agreement, and grammatical nuances in translation.",
